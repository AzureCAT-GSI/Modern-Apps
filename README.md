# Architecting Modern Cloud Apps
Modern cloud applications offer end-user experiences and features that transcend traditional on-premises applications.  For example, there are often multiple database technologies supporting today's modern app.  Embrace the notion of polyglot persistence and see how RDBMS's, NoSQL databases, and caches can be combined to deliver robust end-user experiences.  Modern cloud apps today are also expected to be reachable regardless of the platform or device.  See how Azure's App Service can be used to expand the reach of your solutions.  Modern cloud apps are also not always just platform-as-a-service solutions.  Learn about modern architecture patterns enabled by Azure that span infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service deployments.
